    "The game displays a first person view of the maze. When moving, your direction does not change. So when moving side to side, the perspective remains facing in the same direction (It's actually really easy to implement automatic turning but makes testing and playing the game much more confusing). When you have reached the goal, the center of the screen should print \"You Win!.\" You can continue to move around after. Close the window to stop the cell from running.\n",
